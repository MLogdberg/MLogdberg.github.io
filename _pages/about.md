*Mattias Lögdberg, Serverless and Integration enthusisast.*

My specialty has always been on integrating systems and during the past years cloud integration on the Azure platform has been the main focus.

Today you can find me in various roles, all from developing tools to improve the developer experience for developers with the Azure platform to drafting integration architecture for enterprise hybrid/cloud customers. Implementing these architectures by leading development teams and doing inspiration sessions at clients to promote new way of thinking and introduce new Azure services. My experience in the Azure platform and specificly the Integration Area and the love I have for sharing my findings and knowledge has lead med to be awarded by Microsft with a Most Valuable Professional (MVP) since 2017.

I also run the Integration User Group in Sweden (local events in Stockholm and Gothenburg) and I like talk to new people so if you have used my blog or see me at a conference or on social medias, stop me and say 'hi'.
