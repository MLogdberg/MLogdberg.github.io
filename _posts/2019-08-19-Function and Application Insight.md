Azure Functions is a great tool in our toolbox and as all our tools they have theire strengths and flaws. When it comes to logging and monitoring Functions rely on Application Insight's and later on Azure Monitor.
It's also alot dependent on how you implement your solution, and there are som **out of box** features that are really amazing.

If you are unfamiliar with Functions and Application Insights, read more here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-monitoring)


By just enabling application insights, without any further addons we get all the logs that are sent to the *ILogger* object to application Insights. And we also get some **End-To-End** tracking via supported SDK's and HttpClient requests. This is very useful to get an understanding of what is happening.
So let's look in to how this can be in a rather complex scenario.

The Scenario is that a message is recieve via API Management, sent to a Function that publish the message on a topic, a second Function reads the published message and publish the message on a second topic, a third Function recieves the message and sends it to a Logic App that represents a "3:e party system".

After connecting all functions the **same** Application Insight instance we are sending a message! Let's see how this can look like in Application Insights, first we go to the Performance tab:

![Performance tab](/assets/uploads/2019/08/functionsAi-performancetab.png)

First let's just point out some small good to know things, the Operation Name in this view is actually the name of the function that you execute, so Function 1 in the list of Operation Names bellow:

![Operation Name](/assets/uploads/2019/08/functionsAi-endtoendoverview-OperationName.png)

Has this signature in the code **FunctionName("Function1")**, this is important as your instances grow make sure to make the name of the function unique to eaqsily find em.


```csharp
 [FunctionName("Function1")]
        [return: ServiceBus("topic1", Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.ServiceBus.EntityType.Topic, Connection = "servicebusConnection")]
        public static async Task<string> Run(
            [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
            ILogger log)
        {
```

Then we pick one of the requests, press the *samples* and pick one, it loads the end-to-end overivew

We can actually see all the steps from the first function to the last function and the call to the Logic App, impressive! The message is beeing sent over Service bus topics but the correlation is all set and we can follow the message all the way!
Let's look in some special ways of adding custom information to the logs.















I'm out doing educations and it's both fun and a great chance for me to learn new stuffs since it's always something that just for no reason going south.


So today I was out on one of these missions and we where doing some labs developing functions, when we added an extra input from a table storage the Function App just chrashed and then we just got errors that the site was offline and it dident come up. Everybody encountered it so I had to investigate.

The response was a *503 Service Unavailable* and the body was the following html content (removed the style since it just took alot of space):

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" >
<head>
    <title>Host Offline</title>
 </head>
<body>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="wrapper">
        
        <div id="page">
            <div id="content">

                <div class="box">
                    <h2>This Azure Functions app is down for maintenance</h2>
                    <p>
                        Host is offline
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
     
</body>
</html>
```

So what did we do to get here? Well we just wanted to add an input to from a **Table Storage** to a standard HTTP Trigger and we started from a blank new defualt function.

Here is my default http function:
![Defualt Http Trigger](/assets/uploads/2019/01/functions-defualt-http-trigger.png)

Then I went to the *Integrate* pane and started to add the input from my **Azure Table Storage** 

![Integrate Pane](/assets/uploads/2019/01/functions-adding-table-storage-input.png)

After selecting the **Azure Table Storage** we get an warning that the extension is not installed, let's install it!

![Install Storage Extension](/assets/uploads/2019/01/functions-install-storage-extension.png)

It's installing and we proceed as told in the message:

![Install Storage Extension Message](/assets/uploads/2019/01/functions-install-storage-extension-install-msg.png)

So we just continued and filled the other details and pressed Save.

After that we went back to the function to add the input, it's just a simple signature update from:
```c#
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest req, ILogger log)
```
To:
```c#
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest req,Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JArray inputTable, ILogger log)
```

Now when we run the function the inputTable should be populated from the **Azure Table Storage** but when we try to execute it we just get a http error code **503 Service Unavailable** and in the body I can see the text "Host Offline".

![503 Service Unavailable Host Offline](/assets/uploads/2019/01/functions-install-storage-host-offline.png)

So we started to look into this and read that it could be due to extension not installed properly, to fix this we followed this guide: [https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/wiki/Updating-your-function-app-extensions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/wiki/Updating-your-function-app-extensions)

If you have the same problemes make sure that the extension file exists and contains atleast **"Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage** if not create and/or add **"Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage** to the file.
Sample bellow:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
    <WarningsAsErrors />
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage" Version="3.0.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Script.ExtensionsMetadataGenerator" Version="1.0.*" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>  
```
If you are missing the file it can easily be created in the command prompt witb a simple script:
```cmd
echo.>extensions.csproj
```

Run the build command (this takes a while to run so be patient):
```cmd
dotnet build extensions.csproj -o bin --no-incremental --packages D:\home\.nuget
```

![Restore extension build complete](/assets/uploads/2019/01/functions-install-storage-complete-restore.png)

So now the extensions is installed, let's verify if this solves the issue completly? Start the Function App and test the function again.

If you are as unlucky as me and the function is  **not** working we need to do one more thing.
Let's go back to Kudos and the CMD Prompt again, the problem is the  **app_offline.htm** file:

![Restore extension build complete](/assets/uploads/2019/01/functions-install-extension-offline.png)

Delete it and go back and test agian, it works again!

![Restore extension build complete](/assets/uploads/2019/01/functions-working.png)


## Summary:
The problem is that the extension is not properly installed and when we add the extension in the configuration without the extension installed the Function App chrashes as produces the **app_offline.htm** and if it's present in the folder the response is defaulted to 503 and Host Offline, by removing the file the Function App starts executing as normal and if we have fixed the extensions no errors comes up. This works for all extensions.

By showing the problem and the reproduce scenario we can help out improving the products! So I hope this helps anyone and leads to a fix from the prodcut team.
