Azure Functions is a great tool in our toolbox and as all our tools they have theire strengths and flaws. When it comes to logging and monitoring Functions rely on Application Insight's and later on Azure Monitor.
It's also alot dependent on how you implement your solution, and there are som **out of box** features that are really amazing.

If you are unfamiliar with Functions and Application Insights, read more here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-monitoring)


By just enabling application insights, without any further addons we get all the logs that are sent to the *ILogger* object to application Insights. And we also get some **End-To-End** tracking via supported SDK's and HttpClient requests. This is very useful to get an understanding of what is happening.
So let's look in to how this can be in a rather complex scenario.

The Scenario is that a message is recieve via API Management, sent to a Function that publish the message on a topic, a second Function reads the published message and publish the message on a second topic, a third Function recieves the message and sends it to a Logic App that represents a "3:e party system".

After connecting all functions the **same** Application Insight instance we are sending a message! Let's see how this can look like in Application Insights, first we go to the Performance tab:

![Performance tab](/assets/uploads/2019/08/functionsAi-performancetab.png)

First let's just point out some small good to know things, the Operation Name in this view is actually the name of the function that you execute, so Function 1 in the list of Operation Names bellow:

![Operation Name](/assets/uploads/2019/08/functionsAi-endtoendoverview-OperationName.png)

Has this signature in the code **FunctionName("Function1")**, this is important as your instances grow make sure to make the name of the function unique to eaqsily find em.


```csharp
 [FunctionName("Function1")]
        [return: ServiceBus("topic1", Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.ServiceBus.EntityType.Topic, Connection = "servicebusConnection")]
        public static async Task<string> Run(
            [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
            ILogger log)
        {
```

Then we pick one of the requests, press the *samples* and pick one, it loads the end-to-end overivew


![End to end Overview](/assets/uploads/2019/08/functionsAi-endtoendoverview.png)

We can actually see all the steps from the first function to the last function and the call to the Logic App, impressive! The message is beeing sent over Service bus topics but the correlation is all set and we can follow the message all the way!

So this is truly awesome and alot of standard Properties are set out of box, but none specific to our request so it's hard to understand what data is sent so let's look in some special ways of adding custom information to the logs.

## Logs in Application Insights

The simplest one just adding a Log text with some unique data this is to log our productnumber, so we can see what productnumber this request is processing:
```csharp
	log.LogInformation("ProductNumber {productnumber}", productnumber);
```

Let's move to the collected Telemetry to see this log:

![Scenario image](/assets/uploads/2019/08/functionsAi-viewTelemetry.png)


And now we can find our log row:

![ProductNumber log row](/assets/uploads/2019/08/functionsAi-informationlogproductnumber.png)


So now we know this request is processing the specifc product, this is searchable in the Search Menu, and an easy click will take you to the End-to-End tracking. 

![ProductNumber log row](/assets/uploads/2019/08/functionsAi-searchProduct.png)

## Add Filterable Property to Request
But let's say that we want to not just find a specific run, we want to understand overall performance or errors on a more wider term, like for a market. Let's consider we want to understand performance or failures for a specific market. This is done via the *Performance* or *Failures* tabs, but in order to narrow down the data presented we need to be able to filter the data like the the image bellow adding a filter on **Market**.

![ProductNumber log row](/assets/uploads/2019/08/functionsAi-performance-expectedsearch.PNG)

To get this working we need to add an property to our request log. (The request log is the first log event, see the telemetry for more information) the code to achieve this is super simple we just need to add this small snippet of code:

```csharp
System.Diagnostics.Activity.Current?.AddTag("Market", market);
```

The function now looks like:
```csharp
  public static class Function1
    {
        [FunctionName("Function1")]
        [return: ServiceBus("topic1", Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.ServiceBus.EntityType.Topic, Connection = "servicebusConnection")]
        public static async Task<string> Run(
            [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
            ILogger log)
        {
            log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

            string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
            dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);
            string productnumber = (string)data.productnumber;
            string market = (string)data.marketnumber;

            log.LogInformation("ProductNumber {productnumber}", productnumber);
            System.Diagnostics.Activity.Current?.AddTag("Market", market);

           
            return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(data);
        }
    }
```

This will now give us the following result:

In the *Search* section we can pick the **Market** in the filter to build our queries.

In the Search section we can pick the **Market** in the filter to build our queries.

![Search with add filter Market](/assets/uploads/2019/08/functionsAi-searchMarket.PNG)

In the *Performance* and *Failures* sections we need to add a bit more to be able to work with the filter, we need to add **customDimensions** before **Market** making the filter look like **customDimensions.Market**.

![Search with add filter Market](/assets/uploads/2019/08/functionsAi-perfromancecustomdimensionsearch.png)

And as you can see we get the filtered result after pressing the green confirm button.

![Search with add filter Market](/assets/uploads/2019/08/functionsAi-perfromancecustomdimensionsearchafter.png)

Adding more *Tags* will allow more possibliites for search, the tag will be attached only to the request log entry and not to the following traces, if we need to keep track of thing inside loops we need to introduce another way of logging.




## Connecting cutom logs from TelemetryClient
Either we need more custom logging options than the one the standard *ILogger* provides or we have alot of logging today that is not connected to the endo to end scenario. We need attach these to our end-to-end logging experience via the **TelemtryClient** to take advantage of the more advanced logging features.

In order to achieve this we need to add some context properties to our instance, here is one way to do this via Service Bus, here we recieve the Message object.

From the Message object we can extract the Activity, this is an extension in the *Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus.Diagnostics* namespace. From this we can get the *RootId* and *ParentId* wich is the current Operation Id and the parent id. [Read more on how the Operation id is built and how the hierarchy is designed](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/HierarchicalRequestId.md)

```csharp
  public string Run([ServiceBusTrigger("topic1", "one", Connection = "servicebusConnection")]Message message, ILogger log)
        {
            string response = "";
            var activity = message.ExtractActivity();

            telemetryClient.Context.Operation.Id = activity.RootId;
            telemetryClient.Context.Operation.ParentId = activity.ParentId;

            telemetryClient.TrackTrace("Received message");
```

Now we will also add this small line of code that trackes an event.

```csharp
	var evt = new EventTelemetry("Function called");
	evt.Context.User.Id = "dummyUser";
	this.telemetryClient.TrackEvent(evt);
```

And this can now be found in the end-to-end tracing.

## Summary:
The problem is that the extension is not properly installed and when we add the extension in the configuration without the extension installed the Function App chrashes as produces the **app_offline.htm** and if it's present in the folder the response is defaulted to 503 and Host Offline, by removing the file the Function App starts executing as normal and if we have fixed the extensions no errors comes up. This works for all extensions.

By showing the problem and the reproduce scenario we can help out improving the products! So I hope this helps anyone and leads to a fix from the prodcut team.
