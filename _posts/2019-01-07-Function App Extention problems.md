I'm out doing educations and it's both fun and a great chance for me to learn new stuffs since it's always something that just for no reason going south.


So today I was out on one of these missions and we where doing some labs developing functions, when we added an extra input from a table storage the Function App just chrashed and then we just got errors that the site was offline and it dident come up. Everybody encountered it so I had to investigate.

The response was a *503 Service Unavailable* and the body was the following html content (removed the style since it just took alot of space):

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" >
<head>
    <title>Host Offline</title>
 </head>
<body>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="wrapper">
        
        <div id="page">
            <div id="content">

                <div class="box">
                    <h2>This Azure Functions app is down for maintenance</h2>
                    <p>
                        Host is offline
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
     
</body>
</html>
```

So what did we do to get here? Well we just wanted to add an input to from a **Table Storage** to a standard HTTP Trigger and we started from a blank new defualt function.

Here is my default http function:
![Defualt Http Trigger](/assets/uploads/2019/01/functions-defualt-http-trigger.png)

Then I went to the *Integrate* pane and started to add the input from my **Azure Table Storage** 

![Integrate Pane](/assets/uploads/2019/01/functions-adding-table-storage-input.png)

After selecting the **Azure Table Storage** we get an warning that the extension is not installed, let's install it!

![Install Storage Extension](/assets/uploads/2019/01/functions-install-storage-extension.png)

It's installing and we proceed as told in the message:

![Install Storage Extension Message](/assets/uploads/2019/01/functions-install-storage-extension-install-msg.png)

So we just continued and filled the other details and pressed Save.

After that we went back to the function to add the input, it's just a simple signature update from:
```c#
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest req, ILogger log)
```
To:
```c#
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest req,Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JArray inputTable, ILogger log)
```

Now when we run the function the inputTable should be populated from the **Azure Table Storage** but when we try to execute it we just get a http error code **503 Service Unavailable** and in the body I can see the text "Host Offline".

![503 Service Unavailable Host Offline](/assets/uploads/2019/01/functions-install-storage-host-offline.png)

So we started to look into this and read that it could be due to extension not installed properly, to fix this we followed this guide: [https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/wiki/Updating-your-function-app-extensions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/wiki/Updating-your-function-app-extensions)

If you have the same problemes make sure that the extension file exists and contains atleast **"Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage** if not create and/or add **"Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage** to the file.
Sample bellow:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
    <WarningsAsErrors />
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage" Version="3.0.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Script.ExtensionsMetadataGenerator" Version="1.0.*" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>  
```
If you are missing the file it can easily be created in the command prompt witb a simple script:
```cmd
echo.>extensions.csproj
```

Run the build command (this takes a while to run so be patient):
```cmd
dotnet build extensions.csproj -o bin --no-incremental --packages D:\home\.nuget
```

So now the extensions is installed, let's verify if this solves the issue completly? Start the Function App and test the function again.

If you are as unlucky as me and the function is  **not** working we need to do one more thing.
Let's go back to Kudos and the CMD Prompt again, the problem is the  **app_offline.htm** file:

![Restore extension build complete](/assets/uploads/2019/01/functions-install-extension-offline.png)

Delete it and go back and test agian, it works again!

## Summary:
The problem is that the extension is not properly installed and when we add the extension in the configuration without the extension installed the Function App chrashes as produces the **app_offline.htm** and if it's present in the folder the response is defaulted to 503 and Host Offline, by removing the file the Function App starts executing as normal and if we have fixed the extensions no errors comes up. This works for all extensions.

By showing the problem and the reproduce scenario we can help out improving the products! So I hope this helps anyone and leads to a fix from the prodcut team.
