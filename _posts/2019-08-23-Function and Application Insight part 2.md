In part one we covered the ILogger interface and what it's providing for us, but sometimes we want more control of our logging or we have allready implemented alot of custom logging and just want to "connect" the logging to our **end-to-end** experience.

We use the same Scenario, a message is recieve via API Management, sent to a Azure Function that publishes the message on a topic, a second Azure Function reads the published message and publishes the message on a second topic, a third Azure Function recieves the message and sends the message over http to a Logic App that represents a "3:e party system".

Read more about the scenario background and the standard *ILogger* interface in previous post [Azure Functions logs in Application Insights](http://mlogdberg.com/2019/02/functions/understandhowlogsinai).


## Connecting custom logs from TelemetryClient
Either we need more custom logging options than the one the standard *ILogger* provides or we have alot of logging today that is not connected to the endo to end scenario. We need attach these to our end-to-end logging experience via the **TelemtryClient** to take advantage of the more advanced logging features.

In order to achieve this we need to add some context properties to our instance, here is one way to do this via Service Bus, here we recieve the Message object.

From the Message object we can extract the Activity, this is an extension in the *Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus.Diagnostics* namespace. From this we can get the *RootId* and *ParentId* wich is the current Operation Id and the parent id. [Read more on how the Operation id is built and how the hierarchy is designed](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/HierarchicalRequestId.md)

```csharp
public string Run([ServiceBusTrigger("topic1", "one", Connection = "servicebusConnection")]Message message, ILogger log)
{
    string response = "";
    var activity = message.ExtractActivity();

    telemetryClient.Context.Operation.Id = activity.RootId;
    telemetryClient.Context.Operation.ParentId = activity.ParentId;

    telemetryClient.TrackTrace("Received message");
```

This can also be done from a HTTP call [read more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/custom-operations-tracking#http-request-in-owin-self-hosted-app).

```csharp
// If there is a Request-Id received from the upstream service, set the telemetry context accordingly.
if (context.Request.Headers.ContainsKey("Request-Id"))
{
    var requestId = context.Request.Headers.Get("Request-Id");
    // Get the operation ID from the Request-Id (if you follow the HTTP Protocol for Correlation).
    telemetryClient.Context.Operation.Id = GetOperationId(requestId);
    telemetryClient.Context.Operation.ParentId = requestId;
}
	
//GetOperationId method
public static string GetOperationId(string id)
{
    // Returns the root ID from the '|' to the first '.' if any.
    int rootEnd = id.IndexOf('.');
    if (rootEnd < 0)
        rootEnd = id.Length;

    int rootStart = id[0] == '|' ? 1 : 0;
    return id.Substring(rootStart, rootEnd - rootStart);
}
```


Now we will also add this small line of code that trackes an event.

```csharp
var evt = new EventTelemetry("Function called");
evt.Context.User.Id = "dummyUser";
telemetryClient.TrackEvent(evt);
```

And this can now be found in the end-to-end tracing.

## Adding an Extra "Operation"
When processing messages some of the steps are bigger and more important to understand, this could be a complex transformation or just a set of steps that we want to group.
Then we can use the *StartOperation* in *TelemetryClient*, this will start the scope for the *Operation* and it will be open until we execute the operation *StopOperation*.

An Operation is either a Dependency Operation, intended to mark dependency to other resources or a RequestOperation meant for marking a creation of a request.
I will use a DependencyOperation in my case since it's the most alike operation for my purpose, I use it to mark that a more complex logic has been executed in my function and what the result of it was.

I use this i.e. when I process alot of items in my Function to mark that they are executed, like processing a record in a list.

In my example bellow I'll demonstrate the usage of an operation by doing a simple for loop and simulating processing of a lineadding  aprocess

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    var op = telemetryClient.StartOperation<DependencyTelemetry>(string.Format("Function2_line_{0}", i.ToString()));

    op.Telemetry.Data = string.Format("Processing {0} and random guid {1}", i.ToString(), Guid.NewGuid().ToString());
    op.Telemetry.Type = "LineProcessor";
    op.Telemetry.Success = i < 9;
    op.Telemetry.Sequence = i.ToString();
    op.Telemetry.Context.GlobalProperties.Add("LineID", i.ToString());
	
	//do some heavy work!
	
    telemetryClient.StopOperation(op);                    
}
```

This will result in a mutch more detailed log in the **End-To-End** overview

Custo properties is easily seton each operation for traceability or information

```csharp
op.Telemetry.Context.GlobalProperties.Add("LineID", i.ToString());
```

We can also set the Operation to have failed even if we continued the run, good for marking parts of failure while still needing to complete the rest of the run.

Then we can find it under failures and from there start working on how to fix it.

## Summary:
In this second part we have covered more advanced logging with TelemetryClient or to connect your current TelemetryClient logging to the End-To-End experience provided by Application Insights.

This post is about how things can be done and hopefully this can be a guidance in creating a better logging experience, we want to avoid the developers "let me just attach my debugger" response to what is the problem with the flow running in production.
