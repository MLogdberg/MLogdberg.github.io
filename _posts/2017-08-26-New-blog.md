#h2 Time to create my own blog
I've been blogging alot on my work blog, ![ibiz-solutions][http://blog.ibiz-solutions.se/]
and now I've felt that I'm ready for my own blog. I'll keep with the same line, bloggin about Integration and most part will most surely be about Integration in Azure.

I'll cover updates on the source projects I contriubute to here i.e Logic App Template Creator and some other new fun projects, so stay tuned and poke me if I'm keeping a to low pase on my blog.

Cheers!
